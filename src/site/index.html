        <h2>What is FreeSheet?</h2>
        <p>FreeSheet is a really simple functional-style programming language.<br>
            It is intended to be easy enough to be usable by people without programming experience,
            but also powerful enough to use in a wide range of applications.</p>

        <p>A FreeSheet program is easy to write and understand because it is just a list of names and formulas.
            You can enter the names and formulas in a worksheet, and see the results immediately - so debugging is easy.
            The results also update continuously as new inputs arrive.
        </p>

        <p>Right now, you can use FreeSheet programs in web pages to make simple, powerful browser applications ranging from games to business systems.
        You will soon also be able to have FreeSheet programs running on the server as web services.</p>

        <h2 id="technical_overview">Technical Overview</h2>


        <p>A FreeSheet program is just a list of names and definitions.
            Functions with no arguments are called 'named values', and they are evaluated continuously.
            Functions with arguments are only evaluated when they are used in the definitions of other functions.</p>

        <p>A function definition is an expression which can use:</p>

        <ul>
            <li>literals for simple types, lists and objects</li>
            <li>arithmetic and logical operators</li>
            <li>function calls</li>
        </ul>

        <p>FreeSheet can be written as plain text, but the simple 'name = expression' format
            means it can also be displayed in a table.<br>
            The associated <a href="https://github.com/FreeSheetTech">freesheet-web</a> project provides tools for
            editing FreeSheet programs in a spreadsheet-like
            table,
            which also displays the current value of each named value.</p>

        <p>A larger FreeSheet application would probably be organised into multiple separate worksheets to make it
            easier to
            understand.
            A worksheet can reference values in other worksheets.</p>

        <p>As well as functions defined in the worksheet by the user, the worksheet can provide pre-defined functions.
            FreeSheet provides a number of generally useful functions, but an application can easily add new pre-defined
            functions (written in JavaScript).</p>

        <h3><a id="user-content-reactivity" class="anchor" href="#reactivity" aria-hidden="true"></a>Reactivity</h3>

        <p>A really important point about FreeSheet programs is that they don't just run and then stop.
            When started, they wait for inputs and continuously update all their named values as new inputs arrive.
            They also update named values if function definitions are changed while the program is running.
            Other parts of the application can easily register to be notified of these changes.</p>

        <h3><a id="user-content-implementation" class="anchor" href="#implementation" aria-hidden="true"></a>Implementation
        </h3>

        <p>FreeSheet is written in Coffeescript. It uses many open source libraries, notably Pegjs for parsing and Rx JS
            for the reactive functionality.</p>

        <p>The <a href="https://github.com/FreeSheetTech/freesheet">core freesheet project</a> can parse freesheet
            programs from text,
            and run a set of worksheets. </p>

        <p>The <a href="https://github.com/FreeSheetTech/freesheet-web">freesheet web project</a> provides tools and
            components
            for running FreeSheet in web pages.
        </p>

        <h3><a id="user-content-suitability-for-non-technical-users" class="anchor"
               href="#suitability-for-non-technical-users" aria-hidden="true"></a>Non-technical users</h3>

        <p>Being easy to learn and use for non-technical people was a key design aim of FreeSheet.
            The goal is that people who can use formulas with functions in a spreadsheet should be able to start
            programming in FreeSheet in an hour or so.
            Among the characteristics that contribute to this are:</p>

        <ul>
            <li>Very simple syntax with just functions and expressions</li>
            <li>Worksheet tools to edit and run FreeSheet programs that are similar to spreadsheets</li>
            <li>Continuous evaluation of expressions while running</li>
            <li>Being able to see the current values of expressions all the time</li>
        </ul>
