    <h1>FreeSheet for Programmers</h1>

    <p>FreeSheet is a language designed to be </p>
    <ul>
        <li>simple enough for people with no programming experience to learn to use it</li>
        <li>powerful enough for real applications built by professional programmers</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
    This is a fast-paced introduction for experienced programmers that explains how to program in FreeSheet and also
        how to embed it in your applications.</p>

    <h2>FreeSheet in a nutshell</h2>

    <p>
        FreeSheet is a <em>functional-like</em><sup>*</sup> language where everything is an expression or a function
        definition.
        There is no control-flow &mdash; just named expressions that can use the values of other expressions.
        There are no input/output statements. You can define a named input, and any named expression
        is available as an output. How the inputs arrive and how the outputs are consumed is up to the <strong>host
        application</strong>
        in which it is embedded. The current implementation of FreeSheet is written in Coffeescript, so the host
        application can be JavaScript
        running in the browser or in node.js.</p>

    <p class="note" id="functional_like">
        * "Functional-like" because it has some of the characteristics of functional programming languages,
        but it is in no way trying to compete with the likes of Haskell. It doesn't even have explicit types...
    </p>


    <h2>It's live</h2>

    <p>
        You don't just run a FreeSheet program, give it a set of inputs, get the outputs and finish.
        Once started, a FreeSheet program runs continuously, re-evaluating the outputs every time an input changes.
    </p>

    <h2>What does it look like?</h2>

    <h3>Text form</h3>

    <p>
        FreeSheet programs can be written in plain text as a set of definitions of the form <code>name =
        expression</code>. Expressions can refer to other names. For example:
    </p>

    <pre id="example1Code">
        a = 10;
        b = 20;
        c = a + b;
    </pre>


    <h3>The worksheet</h3>

    <p>
        The simple structure fits well into a table, so FreeSheet comes with a worksheet tool which shows the name and
        definition along with the current value:
    </p>

    <div data-sheetname="example1" data-showcode>
        name = "World";
        greeting = "Hello " + name + "!";
    </div>


    <p>You can edit the program in the worksheet and see the updates immediately.  Just click or double-click a Name or Formula
        cell in the table above (or any other example on this page).</p>

    <h2>The language</h2>

    <h3>Types and Literals</h3>

    <p>Types are not defined explicitly in FreeSheet, but they do exist - like in JavaScript.
    </p>

    <p>
        Literal values are written like this:
    </p>


    <div data-sheetname="example2" data-showcode>
        string = "Hello!";
        number = 25.5;
        date = dateValue("2015-10-31");
        list = ["List", "of", 4, "items"];
        group = {name: "Fred", score: 100};
        nullValue = none;
    </div>
    <p>The <em>group</em> type is a set of name-expression pairs that is like a map, hash, dictionary, object, lookup or
        whatever in other languages.</p>


    <h3>Simple expressions</h3>

    <p>There are operators for: </p>
    <table class="definitions table table-bordered">
        <tr>
            <td>Arithmetic</td>
            <td>+ - * /</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>Comparisons</td>
            <td>== <> > < >= <=</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>Logical</td>
            <td>and or</td>
        </tr>
    </table>
    <p>They have the same precedence as in most languages, and you can use brackets to override that.</p>

    <p>The <code>+</code> operator also: </p>
    <ul>
        <li>concatenates strings</li>
        <li>concatenates arrays</li>
        <li>merges groups</li>
        <li>adds time periods to dates</li>
    </ul>

    <div data-sheetname="example3" data-showcode>
        a = 10;
        b = 20;
        p = (a + 5) * b - 1;
        q = b == a;
        r = b > a and ("x" == "y" or a == 10);
    </div>

    <h3>Function calls</h3>

    <p>
        FreeSheet expressions can call functions. Some core functions come with FreeSheet (like <code>ifElse</code> and
        <code>sum</code>).
        The host application can provide further functions (like <code>addFortyTwo</code> in the example below).
        A FreeSheet program can also define its own functions - more on that later.
    </p>

    <div data-sheetname="example4" data-showcode>
        scores = [10, 17, 4, 31];
        total = sum(scores);
        bonusPoints = ifElse(count(scores) > 3, 20, 0);
        finalScore = addFortyTwo(total + bonusPoints);
    </div>

    <h2>Input, Output and the Host Application</h2>

    <p>
        Ok - no program is much use unless you can get data in and out. To get data into a FreeSheet program, you have to define a named input.
        Then the host application can send data to that input.  The host application can also register callbacks for changes in the outputs (any named expression can be an output).
    </p>
    <p>
        Here is a simple FreeSheet program with an input, <code>name</code>.  The host application (this web page) sends an input every time the value in the textbox changes.
        It also registers a callback for changes in <code>greeting</code> and displays that in the page.
    </p>

    <h4>Hello You</h4>
    <div data-sheetname="exampleInput" data-showcode>
        name = input;
        greeting = "Hello " + name + "!";
    </div>

    <div>
        <label>What is your name?</label>
        <input type="text" id="yourName" placeholder="Enter your name here"/>
        <span id="greeting"></span>
    </div>

    <h4>JavaScript code</h4>
    <div data-sourceid="exampleInputScript"></div>

    <h2>Functions that operate on lists</h2>
    <p>Some functions operate on lists, applying an expression to each one:</p>
    <ol>
        <li><code>fromEach</code> - returns a list that is the result of applying an expression to each item (aka map, each in other languages)</li>
        <li><code>select</code> - returns a list that contains the elements where the expression returns true (aka filter in other languages)</li>
    </ol>
    <p>The expression uses the special name <code>in</code> to refer to the current item.</p>

    <h4>List operations</h4>
    <div data-sheetname="exampleList">
        highScoreThreshold = 10;
        scores = [{name: "Abby", points: 10},
                  {name: "Billy",  points: 5},
                  {name: "Carys", points: 15}];
        highScores = select(scores, in.points >= highScoreThreshold);
        highScorers = fromEach(highScores, in.name);
    </div>
    <p><em>Note:</em> these expressions look simple so non-programmers are not scared off, but the functional programmers
    will recognise that these are higher-order functions being passed a lambda expression that acts a bit like a closure.
    The expression reacts to changes in the values it uses - try changing <code>highScoreThreshold</code> to 5 or 12 in the example.
        The lambda expression and all the expressions that depend on it are recalculated.
        Not really so simple underneath.</p>

    <h2>So far, so Excel-lent</h2>
    <p>At this point you might ask - can't most of what we have seen so far can be done in a spreadsheet?  Well, yes - some of it can.
    And FreeSheet is deliberately presented in a spreadsheet-like style to make it more approachable to non-programmers.  But a spreadsheet can't:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>receive new inputs and notify changes in the outputs</li>
        <li>be embedded in a web page</li>
        <li>have complex types like lists and groups in cells</li>
        <li>show a name, formula and value all together in the same place</li>
    </ul>
    <p>But the big difference is something else...</p>

    <h2>Events over time</h2>
    <p>A spreadsheet just shows you a static calculation.  If you change the value in a cell, the sheet updates and the previous value, or even the fact that it arrived, is lost.
    In FreeSheet, inputs and the calculated expressions are regarded as streams of events.
        Every time a new input is received, any expression that depends on it is recalculated and outputs a new event.
    </p>

    <p>You may just be interested in the fact that an input event has arrived, rather than it's value.  A button click would be a good example of this.</p>

    <p>
        Or you can do calculations with the whole sequence of values that an expression has had since the program started running.
        To get a sequence of values, you use the <code>all</code> function.
    </p>

    <h3>Tracking Sales</h3>
    <p>In this example we have several inputs, but we want to capture the details of a sale only when all the details are entered and a button is clicked.
        We also want to calculate the total amounts from the sales over the day.  We use:
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>the <code>onChange</code> function to react to the event of clicking a button and snapshot the values of the other inputs as a complete sale</li>
        <li>the <code>all</code> function to do calculations over the list of all sales</li>
    </ul>

    <p>Enter two or three sales and see what happens.</p>
    <div data-sheetname="sales">
        taxRate = 0.2;
        customerIn = input;
        partsIn = input;
        labourIn = input;
        recordSale = input;
        customer = onChange(recordSale, customerIn);
        parts = onChange(recordSale, asNumber(partsIn));
        labour = onChange(recordSale, asNumber(labourIn));
        subTotal = parts + labour;
        tax = subTotal * taxRate;
        totalToPay = subTotal + tax;
        grossSales = sum(all(totalToPay));
        totalTax = sum(all(tax));
    </div>

    <div>
        <form id="salesForm" class="form-horizontal">
            <div class="form-group">
                <label class="col-sm-2 control-label">Customer Name</label>
                <div class="col-sm-3">
                    <input type="text" class="form-control" name="customer" placeholder="A Buyer">
                </div>
            </div>
            <div class="form-group">
                <label class="col-sm-2 control-label">Parts</label>
                <div class="col-sm-3">
                    <input type="text" class="form-control" name="parts" placeholder="Cost of the parts">
                </div>
            </div>
            <div class="form-group">
                <label class="col-sm-2 control-label">Labour</label>
                <div class="col-sm-3">
                    <input type="text" class="form-control" name="labour" placeholder="Cost of the labour">

            </div>
            <div class="form-group">
                <div class="col-sm-offset-2 col-sm-2">

                </div>
            </div>
        </form>
    </div>

    <div class="invoice">
        <h2>Invoice</h2>
        <table class="definitions  table table-bordered">
            <tr>

                <td><span id="totalTax"></span></td>
            </tr>
        </table>
    </div>

    <h2>Functions that operate on event streams</h2>
    <p>Some functions act on the whole stream of events from an expression rather than individual values, and return another event stream.
    The new stream might have more or fewer events than the incoming stream(s).  Some useful ones are:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><code>all</code> - outputs a stream of lists containing all the incoming values up till now</li>
        <li><code>merge</code> - merge two streams into one</li>
        <li><code>unpackLists</code> - take a stream of lists and output every value of each list individually</li>
        <li><code>onChange</code> - when there is a new value in one stream, take the current value of another</li>
    </ul>

    <p>You can see all of these being used in the <a href="/examples/league">League Table Example</a></p>


    <h2>Defining your own functions</h2>
    <p>
        A functional(like) programming language wouldn't be much use if you couldn't define functions.
        In FreeSheet a function is defined like this: <code>functionName(parameter, parameter...) = expression</code>,
        which is pretty much like a normal named expression except you have parameters.
        The parameter names can be used along with other named values in the expression.
    </p>
    <h4>Function example</h4>
    <div data-sheetname="exampleFunctions">
        taxRate = 0.2;
        taxOn(netAmount) = netAmount * taxRate;
        taxIncludedIn(grossAmount) = grossAmount * taxRate / (1 + taxRate);
        amountWithTax(netAmount) = netAmount + taxOn(netAmount);
        amountWithoutTax(grossAmount) = grossAmount - taxIncludedIn(grossAmount);

        netPrice = 100;
        tax = taxOn(netPrice);
        priceWithTax = amountWithTax(netPrice);
        inclusivePrice = 120;
        taxIncluded = taxIncludedIn(inclusivePrice);
        exclusivePrice = amountWithoutTax(inclusivePrice);
    </div>

    <h2>The Future</h2>
    <p>The potential of FreeSheet is much bigger than this.  Here are some of the future directions it could take.</p>

    <h3>Server-side sheets</h3>
    <p>FreeSheet runs just as well under node.js, so a FreeSheet program could run in a web application in at least two ways:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Handling one type of request: passing request parameters to the inputs and returning a response formed from the outputs</li>
        <li>Handling many types of request: each request goes to a different input and the outputs are published continuously via websocket connections </li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Wiring components together</h3>
    <p>Inputs to a FreeSheet program can come from any datasource that provided a stream of values.
        Outputs can go to any component that accepts a stream of data values.
        Output components could be "active" and do things like adding a record to a database
        or sending an email for each value they receive.  A FreeSheet program could act as "glue", "plumbing" or a "breadboard"
        for wiring such components together and adapting the outputs of one to the inputs of another or providing custom calculations.</p>
    <p>In the browser, these components could be <a href="http://webcomponents.org/">Web Components</a>.</p>


    <h3>Persistent Sheets</h3>
    <p>
        In many applications, especially those that build up information from event streams over time, you can't just throw away the data
        when the application stops or the browser page is closed.  FreeSheet needs to have a way to link a sheet to a data store so
        that inputs or calculated values are stored persistently and can be reloaded when the sheet runs again.
    </p>
    <p>In the browser, this could be HTML5 local storage.  On the server, there would probably need to be a way to link a sheet to database records.</p>

    <h3>Event Sourcing</h3>
    <p>Streams of events being transformed into domain model outputs sounds a lot like the ideas of <a
            href="http://martinfowler.com/eaaDev/EventSourcing.html">Event Sourcing</a> that are becoming popular again.</p>
