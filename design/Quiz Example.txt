Quiz Example
============

- Data defined in worksheet
- Data generates questions and answers on the page
- Answers are an input to the worksheet
- Show marks on the page
- Total score updates
- Time left updates
- Start button shows questions and starts timer
- Game over when all answered or out of time
- Show final result


Combining questions and entered answers
---------------------------------------

- Stream of questions - probably just one value
- Each entered answer gives an event
- Could treat this as:
  - one stream of name-value pair events (not a subject)
  - one stream of name-value pair arrays for all inputs on page
  - one stream of name-value single-pair map arrays for all inputs on page
  - one stream of name-value maps for all inputs on page
  - one stream of name-value maps for a selected set of inputs
  - many streams of values, one for each input
- The actual names depend on the data
- There will also be fixed inputs with known names where one stream for each is best
- Need a function to combine the streams
- Or need a transform function that pulls in a single value, and apply that to each item in the question array
- Need an intuitive way to express it in functions


Possible answer expressions
---------------------------

- enteredAnswers = inputs
- enteredAnswers = filter(inputs, it.class == "expected-answer")
- enteredAnswers = inputs(it.class == "expected-answer")

- combinedAnswers = join(questions, enteredAnswers, "id")
- combinedAnswers = foreach(questions, in + {entered: enteredAnswers[in.id]})
- combinedAnswers = foreach(questions, in + {entered: enteredAnswers(in.id)})
- combinedAnswers = foreach(questions, in + {entered: inputs("q" + in.id)})
- combinedAnswers = foreach(questions, merge(in, {entered: input("q" + in.id)}))

Needed
------
- foreach
- merge
- input
