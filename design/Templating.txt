==========

- Page has mustache-style templates
- worksheetId.itemName
- Need to link in worksheet updates for minimal updating
- Re-render all every time OK for initial
- Tables with rows repeating on each may be a problem
  - can't put {{#each}} around <tr> elements in WYSIWYG
  - browser parser moves the tags outside the table when do $(template).html()
- Repeating block Poss 1: define own helper that goes outside the table or ul but applies to element inside it
- Repeating block Poss 2: define own helper that is actually pre-processed to insert #each in corrrect place
- If dynamically add functions to ReactiveDict for each value put into it, can you use it in templates?
- How create ReactiveDict - auto for each sheet?
- ReactiveDicts parts of Freesheet object?  Simplicity vs flexibility
- Add RDs to the template as helpers?
