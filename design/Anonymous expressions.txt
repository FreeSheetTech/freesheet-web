Anonymous expressions
=====================

Aim
---
- Allow expressions to be entered into the worksheet and evaluated without naming them

Functionality
-------------
- If a formula is entered in a row but not the name, the value is shown
- The formula cannot be referenced in others
- When saved as text, the formula is retained
- When loaded back from text, the formula appears again


Implementation
--------------
- Give anonymous formulas special names in runner, but don't show on sheet
- Special names are __unnamed_nnn
- When a row is changed, if no text in name cell, get or assign special name, use that to set in runner
- If clear name cell, delete function with old name and set it with special name
- If enter name cell in anonymous row, delete function with special name and set it with entered name
- When a row is parsed on initial load, if no text in name cell, assign special name, use that to set in runner
- Store special names in data-attribute
- Remove special name when name entered
